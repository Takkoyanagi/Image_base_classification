Image based classification project from &lt;i>Machine Learning A-Z&lt;sup>TM&lt;/sup> &lt;/i>taught by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves to determine if an image is a cat or dog using convolutional neural network model.  The models were made using Tensorflow backend and Keras package on python.
